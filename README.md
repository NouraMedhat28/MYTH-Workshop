# MYTH-Workshop
The repository has the labs of the MYTH workshop introduced by Steeve Hover the founder of Redwood EDA. The labs are written in TL-Verilog and the simulation is done on Makerchip.
- UPDATE:
The Verilog code is added too with simulation done on Modelsim.
-NOTE:
All the labs after the third one are applications of the pipelining idea.
